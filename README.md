# Welcome

## Introduction

This project is for testing some es6 demos with a wet finger.

## Install 

1. In the project root directory, initialize the npm packages by `npm install`.
2. In the project root directory, run `gulp`.
3. In the `<root>/es5/` directory, run `nodemon demo.js`.

Since `gulp` watches and compiles while `nodemon` detects and run node file both automatically, 
you can modify a specific file, like `demo.js` in `es6/` directory, and see the file output instantly from the nodemon terminal panel without re`nodemon demo.js`, which quite saves one's life.
